# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a ChatGPT clone project with the following specifications (from project.md):
- React-based frontend with Next.js
- Real-time streaming chat functionality
- Chat session management
- Supabase backend integration
- Google authentication

## Development Status

This repository is in early development stage with only project specifications defined. The codebase has not been implemented yet.

## Architecture Considerations

Based on the Korean project specification, the application should be structured as:
- Next.js application with React components
- Supabase integration for data persistence and real-time features
- Google OAuth for user authentication
- Streaming chat interface for real-time responses
- Session management for chat history

## Expected Project Structure

Once implemented, the project will likely follow Next.js conventions:
- `/app` or `/pages` directory for routing
- `/components` for React components
- `/lib` for utility functions and API integrations
- Supabase client configuration
- Authentication setup with Google OAuth

## Branch Information
